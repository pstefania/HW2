Comparison of QuickSort and MergeSort

I implemented the two needed functions which are the quickSort and the mergeSort. Once this task was completed I checked if the functions worked properly and then I timed them individually to have an overview of their velocity. Then, using the function time, I imported both functions into another file which timed both at the same time. (I gave a range of 1000 because we have multiple examples to compare). Changing the range of the random lists that each time would take into account, I noticed that when we have a list with range (10) the quickSort is much faster (quicksort: 1.0967254638671875e-05 mergesort; 2.47955322265625e-05); then as you increase the range it would require more time (seconds) to read the function and complete the task. After I imported the time and both quickSort and mergeSort I added the difference which gives as the average difference of both functions' time. Like when they have a list with range (10) the average difference in running time is: 1.770932156521756e-05. 
As I increased the range of 100 both functions got slower by few seconds (quicksort: 0.00021409988403320312 mergesort; 0.0004220008850097656); both require few milliseconds, but as we can confirm is that the quickSort is faster with an average difference in running time of 0.00022933480737206933. 
Finally I tried to change the range of the list one more time to 1000 and the functions slowdown a little (quicksort: 0.002655029296875 mergesort; 0.004684925079345703), and the average difference of the running time is 0.002371230998912731. 
Nevertheless the quickSort function is faster then the mergeSort even chewing and giving higher range of the lists the quickSort will be slightly faster than the mergeSort.
